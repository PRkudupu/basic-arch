o	Ec2 would have block storage
o	Operating system is stored in the block storage
•	Oldest and the simplest data storage.
•	Would not contain meta data

VOLUME
•	Volume would be attached to blocks.
•	It can be attached or detached to completely different applications.

ADVANTAGES
•	Is the fastest kind of storage.
•	We can make incremental changes to the data.
•	Data is replicated 3x times.
•	High availability and fault tolerant.

USE CASES
•	Used for database storage.
•	Has high read and write speed.
•	Used for backup.
•	Give persistence storage

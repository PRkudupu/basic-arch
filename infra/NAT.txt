NAT (Network address translation)
•	This service is used in routers.
•	Translates a set of ip address into another set of Ip address.
•	Helps preserve the limited amount of IPV4 public IP addresses.
•	It translates private to public and public to private.
 

When a device in the LAN want to connect to the internet, The private IP address will be translated by NAT to the public IP address.

 

IP4 Address
There are 2 types of ipv4 address
Public 
•	Publicly registered on the internet.
•	Must have public ip to access the internet.
•	There are approximately 4 billion ip address available on the internet.
Private
•	It is not publicly registered.
•	Cannot directly access the internet with a private IP
•	Only used internally.

FUTURE
•	We won’t need NAT or private ip addresses. 
•	New generation of IP address, called IPv6.
•	Every device would have its own IP address.
•	Capable to produce over 340 undecillion IP addresses.

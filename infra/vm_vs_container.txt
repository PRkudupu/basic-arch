VIRTUAL MACHINES (VM)
•	Hardware virtualization.
•	Hypervisor is responsible for creating virtualized instances (RAM, STORAGE, NETWORK CARDS).
•	One server acting as different machines (machines are relatively independent of each other).
•	Isolation of machines.
•	Infinite flexibility with hardware.
CONTAINER
•	Operating system level virtualization
•	On top of the hardware there is a kernel, on top of the kernel, we have operating systems, on top of OS we would have the containers.
•	Dealing with process isolation.
•	Each container only needs the libraries for running the application.
•	Has namespace and cgroup which limits and monitors our containers.
•	Has infinite portability. 
Note: Container is defined in a single file known as docker file.

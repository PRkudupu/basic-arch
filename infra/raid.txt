REDUNDANT ARRAY OF INDEPENDENT DISKS
	Need: on disk failure no data would be lost
	There are 5 types of raids
		RAID 0 : 
		RAID 1
		RAID 5
		RAID 1O

RAID 0 :	 
All data lost
Speed is faster
RAID 1:
One disk would have a duplicate copy
 

RAID 5:
•	Most common set up that is used
•	Uses 3 or more disks
•	It is fast and it can store a large amount of data
•	Data is not duplicated. However, it is striped across multiple disks along with parity.
Parity: Used to rebuild the data in case of disk failure

Note: equivalent of 1 entire disk would be used to store parity

 



RAID 10
Combining raid 1 and raid 0 together
•	Benefits  from the fault tolerance of raid 1 and the speed of Raid 0
Note : You can only use 50% of the disk for storage

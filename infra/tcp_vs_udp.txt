TCP (Transmission control protocol)
•	The communication between 2 computers needs to be good and reliable to guarantee that the data is received correctly.
•	Guarantee that all data is received and in order.
•	Connection oriented protocol.
•	2 computers verify the connection without before any communication starts with the help of 3 handshake.
•	It guarantees the transfer of data.
 
      HANDSHAKE
1.	Computer A would send a SYN 
2.	Receiving computer B would send an acknowledgement SYN ACK
3.	Computer A sends response as ACK received as response back to computer B
          

       Note:
o	Web page without tcp then the web page would be out of order.
o	Download without tcp would not be complete download.

UDP (User datagram protocol)
o	Like TCP, used for sending and receiving data.
o	Connectionless oriented protocol.
o	Does not guarantee data delivery (Fire and forget protocol)
o	Due to the less overhead of no guaranteed delivery, UDP is faster than TCP
